OpenSteamTool is a Windows DLL project built with CMake.

## Feature

### Core Unlocks
- Unlock an unlimited number of unowned games.
- Unlock all DLCs for unowned games.
- Support auto load depot decryption keys from Lua config.
- Support auto manifest download via `opensteamtool` / `steamrun` / `wudrm` upstream APIs (default is `opensteamtool`), or a custom Lua endpoint (see [Manifest via Lua](#manifest-via-lua)).
- Support downloading protected games or DLCs that require an access token.
- Support binding manifest to prevent specific games from being updated.

### Hot Reload
- Adding, modifying, deleting, or overwriting `.lua` files in any watched directory automatically triggers a reload. No restart, no offline/online toggle needed.

### Family Sharing and Remote Play
- Bypass Steam Family Sharing restrictions for games that have been added to the library with `addappid` in Lua. All accounts in the Steam Family that participate in sharing must use OpenSteamTool for this to work.

### Compatible with games protected by Denuvo and SteamStub
- SteamStub-only games do not require configuring `AppTicket`. OpenSteamTool can reuse Steam's local ConfigStore ticket and forge the requested AppId through a SteamDRMP off-by-four ticket parsing vulnerability, without injecting into the game process.
- Denuvo-protected games still require explicit ticket data. In `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\{AppId}`, both `AppTicket` and `ETicket` are `REG_BINARY` values.
- Use `setAppTicket(appid, "hex")` and `setETicket(appid, "hex")` in Lua config to write these values to the registry automatically.
- AppTicket priority: explicit tickets have the highest priority, including tickets configured by `setAppTicket` and existing `AppTicket` registry values. If no explicit AppTicket is available, OpenSteamTool falls back to the forged local ConfigStore ticket path.
- SteamID priority: read `SteamID` as `REG_SZ` (numeric-only) first; if missing, parse from explicit `AppTicket`.

#### Extracting tickets with `extract_tickets`

The `extract_tickets` tool dumps the `AppTicket` and `ETicket` hex strings you need for `setAppTicket` / `setETicket`. Run it on a machine where Steam is running and logged into an account that **owns** the target game.

1. Build the tools (see [Build](#build)); the binary lands in `build/tools/Release/extract_tickets.exe`.
2. Run it with the target AppId (or run it with no argument and type the AppId when prompted):
   ```powershell
   extract_tickets.exe 1361510
   ```
3. It reads the Steam install path from the registry, loads `steamclient64.dll`, and writes everything into an `<appid>/` folder next to the executable:
   - `appticket.bin` — raw app ownership ticket (binary)
   - `eticket.bin` — raw encrypted app ticket (binary)
   - `tickets.txt` — plain-text summary with the hex strings:
     ```
     appid:1361510
     appticket(184 bytes):14000000...
     eticket(143 bytes):...
     ```
   A ticket that could not be obtained is reported as `appticket:null` / `eticket:null`.
4. Paste the hex strings from `tickets.txt` into your Lua config:
   ```lua
   setAppTicket(1361510, "14000000...")
   setETicket(1361510, "...")
   ```

> **Note:** Tickets are only valid when extracted from an account that **genuinely owns** the game.

### Stats and Achievements
- Enable stats and achievements for unowned games.
- Uses `setStat(appid, "steamid")` to configure which SteamID's achievement data to pull.
- If no `setStat` is configured for an app, falls back to the hardcoded default SteamID `76561198028121353`.

### Online Fix
- Add `-onlinefix` to the Steam launch parameters to enable 480-based online play in games that use lobby matchmaking. The current limitation is that only one such game can run at a time.To revert, simply remove -onlinefix from the launch parameters — online play returns to normal on the next launch.

## Future
- For games protected by Denuvo and SteamStub, find a safe timing to switch `GetSteamID` (see `src/Hook/Hooks_IPC.cpp#Handler_IClientUser_GetSteamID` TODO) so save files are not affected.(**Suggestions welcome — when is the earliest point after game initialization that we can safely switch the
  SteamID without affecting save file binding?**)
- Steam Cloud synchronization support.(This is a huge project)
- Add Auto Denuvo Authorization Sharing for Legitimate Accounts.

## Usage
1. Run `build.bat` from the project root to build the project.
2. Copy generated `dwmapi.dll`, `xinput1_4.dll` and `OpenSteamTool.dll` to the Steam root directory.
3. Create Lua directory (for example `C:\steam\config\lua`) and place Lua scripts there. The DLL will automatically load and execute them.
4. Lua example:
```lua
addappid(1361510) -- unlock game with appid 1361510

addappid(1361511, 0,"5954562e7f5260400040a818bc29b60b335bb690066ff767e20d145a3b6b4af0") -- unlock game with appid 1361511 depotKey is "5954562e7f5260400040a818bc29b60b335bb690066ff767e20d145a3b6b4af0" 

addtoken(1361510,"2764735786934684318") -- add access token ("2764735786934684318") for game with appid 1361510 
-- No Longer Supported:
--pinApp(1361510) -- pin game with appid 1361510 to prevent it from being updated

setManifestid(1361511,"5656605350306673283") -- pin depotid:1361511 manifest_gid:5656605350306673283, size defaults to 0
setManifestid(1361511,"5656605350306673283", 12345678) -- same but with explicit size

setAppTicket(1361510,"0100000000000000...") -- write AppTicket (REG_BINARY) to HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\1361510\AppTicket

setETicket(1361510,"0100000000000000...") -- write ETicket (REG_BINARY) to HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\1361510\ETicket

setStat(1361510, "76561197960287930") -- use the specified SteamID's achievement data for appid 1361510
-- If not configured, default SteamID 76561198028121353 is used.
```

All function names are **case-insensitive**. `setAppTicket`, `setappticket`, `SetAppticket`, `SETAPPTICKET` etc. are all equivalent. The same applies to every registered function (`addAppId`, `AddToken`, `SETManifestid`, etc.).

### Configuration (optional)

Rename `opensteamtool.example.toml` to `opensteamtool.toml` and place it in the Steam root directory (next to `steam.exe`).
If no config file is found, built-in defaults are used — no auto-creation.

```toml
[log]
# Debug build only.  Level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
level = "info"

[manifest]
# Upstream API for depot manifest request codes.  Options: "opensteamtool", "steamrun", "wudrm"
url = "opensteamtool"

# HTTP timeouts for manifest requests (milliseconds)
timeout_resolve_ms = 5000
timeout_connect_ms = 5000
timeout_send_ms    = 10000
timeout_recv_ms    = 10000

# Additional Lua config directories (optional).
# Files are loaded after the default <Steam>/config/lua folder.
# The default folder is always loaded last so user files take priority.
[lua]
paths = []

# Optional metadata mirror. See "Steam version compatibility" below.
[remote]
# url_template = "https://your.server/{channel}/{component}/{sha256}.toml"
```

### Manifest via Lua

Two manifest code functions are supported:

#### `fetch_manifest_code(gid)`

Basic function that receives only the manifest GID.

#### `fetch_manifest_code_ex(app_id, depot_id, gid)` *(recommended)*

Extended function that receives `app_id`, `depot_id`, and `gid`. Allows constructing API endpoints that require app identification.

The C++ runtime provides two Lua helpers:

| Function | Signature | Returns |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `http_get`  | `http_get(url [, headers])`       | `body, status_code` |
| `http_post` | `http_post(url, body [, headers])` | `body, status_code` |

`headers` is an optional table: `{["Key"]="Value", ...}`.

### Steam version compatibility

OpenSteamTool no longer ships byte-pattern signatures inside the DLL. Instead, on each launch it computes the SHA-256 of `steamclient64.dll` and `steamui.dll` on disk and looks up a matching pattern file from the upstream tracker at [`OpenSteam001/steam-monitor`](https://github.com/OpenSteam001/steam-monitor) (`pattern` branch).

Lookup order (every launch):

1. **GitHub raw** — `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenSteam001/steam-monitor/pattern/...`. Canonical source.
2. **jsDelivr CDN** — automatic fallback if GitHub raw is unreachable (connection refused / timeout / 5xx). No configuration required. Useful in regions where `raw.githubusercontent.com` is blocked but jsDelivr is reachable (e.g. mainland China).
3. **Local cache** — `<Steam>\opensteamtool\pattern\<subdir>\<sha256>.toml`. Used **only** when remote is unreachable. The cache is overwritten after every successful remote fetch.

Remote is consulted on every launch so users automatically pick up upstream re-publications (e.g. the bot adding a new signature, or fixing an existing one) without having to clear any cache.

If a step returns **HTTP 404** the mirror loop stops immediately — all mirrors serve the same content, so a 404 means the upstream bot has not yet published a TOML for this Steam build. The code then falls back to the local cache if one exists; otherwise a one-shot popup appears with the unmatched DLL name, its SHA-256, the expected cache path, and the upstream URL. Only the hooks tied to that DLL are disabled — the rest of OpenSteamTool keeps working.

You can also drop a pattern TOML into the cache directory manually if you know the layout for a given build; the file name must be `<sha256>.toml`. The cache fallback will pick it up the next time remote is unreachable.

> A short outbound HTTPS request is performed at every launch (one per DLL: `steamclient64.dll`, `steamui.dll`). The downloaded bodies are tiny (~10 KB each) and the work runs on a worker thread, so it never blocks Steam's loader.

#### Using a different mirror

For most users, the built-in **GitHub -> jsDelivr** fallback is enough. To use a private mirror or intranet server, configure a full URL template. A custom mirror replaces the built-in remote sources; local cache fallback remains available.

The template must include `{channel}`, `{component}`, and `{sha256}`. Channels currently used are `pattern` and `ipc`.

```toml
[remote]
url_template = "https://your.server/{channel}/{component}/{sha256}.toml"
# url_template = "https://fast.jsdelivr.net/gh/OpenSteam001/steam-monitor@{channel}/{component}/{sha256}.toml"
```

### Debug logging

Debug builds write per-module log files under `<Steam>/opensteamtool/`:

| File | Source | Content |
|------|--------|---------|
| `main.log`          | General | Init, config loading, Lua parsing,Utils |
| `ipc.log`           | `LOG_IPC_*` | IPC commands, InterfaceCall dispatch, spoofing |
| `netpacket.log`     | `LOG_NETPACKET_*` | Network packet send/recv, eMsg dispatch |
| `manifest.log`      | `LOG_MANIFEST_*` | Manifest download, `fetch_manifest_code`,manifest binding |
| `decryptionkey.log` | `LOG_DECRYPTIONKEY_*` | Depot decryption key injection |
| `keyvalue.log`      | `LOG_KEYVALUE_*` | KeyValues patching (manifest binding) |
| `misc.log`          | `LOG_MISC_*` | Engine pointer capture, AppId hints |
| `winhttp.log`       | `LOG_WINHTTP_*` | HTTP requests  |
| `achievement.log`   | `LOG_ACHIEVEMENT_*` | UserStats requests/responses, steamid spoofing |
| `pics.log`          | `LOG_PICS_*` | PICS access token injection |
| `package.log`       | `LOG_PACKAGE_*` | Package injection, FileWatcher events |
| `onlinefix.log`     | `LOG_ONLINEFIX_*` | Online fix (480 AppId spoofing) |

The log level is controlled by `[log] level` in `opensteamtool.toml`.
